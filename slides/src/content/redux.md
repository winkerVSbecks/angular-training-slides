# Managing State with Redux

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-roadmap" -->
## Roadmap

1. How should we keep track of our application's state?
1. What are the principal components of the Redux model?
1. How do we dispatch actions?
1. How do we respond to state changes?
1. What tools are available for working with Redux?

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-problem" -->
## The Problem

- Different parts of an application need to reflect different aspects of its state
- Different parts of an application can *update* different aspects of its state
- Those updates can happen asynchronously

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-what-should-it-do" -->
## What Should a Good State Management System Do?

1. Provide a [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth)
1. Provide [separation of concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
   - Data and logic should be able to evolve separately
1. Improve scalability by having things *react* to events
   - As opposed to a caller dictating actions
1. Create a coherent framework so future developers will know where and how to add features
1. Provide [uni-directional data flow](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/DataFlow.html)
   so that future developers can reason about interactions

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-why-a-new-pattern" -->
## Why Do We Need a New Pattern?

Server requests are different from user interactions:

1. User requests are handled by a single-threaded browser, while server requests are handled by multi-threaded servlets
1. User requests often modify the same objects but server requests usually modify different ones
1. Users expect to be notified about changes immediately: servers are more patient

<!-- .slide: id="redux-the-store" -->
## The Store

- Stores the entire current state of the application
- In principle, entire state replaced each time something changes
  - I.e., state is never modified in place
  - So no need to worry about concurrency effects
  - In practice, can often replace some parts and copy other parts forward
- Application components watch [Observable](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) streams for updates
  and change what they display

FIXME: diagram of state update

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-actions" -->
## Actions

- Actions are objects that tell the store how to update itself
  - Use actions instead of direct function invocation so that they can be serialized
- Each action is an `Object` with:
  - `type`: identifies what kind of action this is (to allow selection and filtering)
  - `payload`: extra information needed to carry out the action
    - This is just a convention, but a widely-used one

+++
<!-- .slide: id="reducers" -->
## Reducers

- When actions are dispatched, reducers are called passing in the current state and the action being dispatched
- A reducer is a pure function (without side-effects) with two parameters
  - `state`: Is the current redux state of your store
  - `action`: Is an `Object` that contains the `type` and `payload`
- Reducers should not mutate the state, but return a copy or a new state

```ts
export function reducer(state: AppState = [], action: Action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ITEM_ADD:
      //...do something with state
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-plan-for-refactoring" -->
## Plan for Refactoring

1. Define the *reducer* that turns a state and an action into a new state
1. Define actions
1. Main component will dispatch an action to add an item
1. Display will monitor the store for changes

Notes:

1. We will use [@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) for our store
   - Many other implementations of the Redux pattern exist
1. We will leave room in our store to add more state later
1. Angular CLI doesn't know anything about @ngrx, so we have to do most of the work by hand

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-tools" -->
## Redux Tools

- Best way to learn Redux is to visualize what it's doing
- Use [Redux DevTools Extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/)
  - Shows application state
  - Provides visualization of all actions that have been dispatch
  - Time travelling by moving backwards and forwards on actions that have been dispatch

+++

<!-- .slide: id="redux-installing-software" -->
## Install Required Software

- `npm install @ngrx/core @ngrx/store --save`
- We will also install the ngrx dev tools
  - `npm install @ngrx/store-devtools --save`
- The `--save` option updates `package.json`
- So the next person can just do `npm install`

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-redux-chrome-extensions" -->
## Install Redux Chrome Extensions

- Works with many other tools:
  - Chrome through the [web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remotedev/)
  - [Electron and others](http://extension.remotedev.io/#installation)
- After installing the extension in Chrome, there should be a tab in Chrome DevTools labelled "Redux".

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-create-the-reducer-1" -->
## Create the Reducer

- Create a new file `src/app/store.ts`
- Import `Action` to define the shape of actions
- Define constants for action names (as strings)
- Also define the initial state
  - An empty item list
- New state is the old list plus a new item
  - New item arrives as action's payload
- Do *not* use `items.push` to update existing state
  - More efficient...
  - ...but only if correctness and programmer time aren't issues

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-create-the-reducer-2" -->
## Create the Reducer

- Set up definitions

#####_src/app/store.ts_
```ts
import { Action } from '@ngrx/store';

export const ITEM_ADD = 'ITEM_ADD';

export interface AppState {
  items: string[];
}

const DEFAULT_STATE: AppState = {
  items: []
};
```

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-create-the-reducer-3" -->
## Create the Reducer

- Define the reducer function

#####_src/app/store.ts_
```ts
export function reducer(state: AppState = DEFAULT_STATE, action: Action) {
  let newState;

  switch (action.type) {

    case ITEM_ADD:
      newState = {items: [...state.items, action.payload]};
      return newState;

    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-add-the-store" -->
## Add the Store to the Application

#####_src/app/app.module.ts_
```ts
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { reducer } from './store';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // ...as before...
  ],
  imports: [
    // ...as before...
    StoreModule.provideStore(reducer)
  ],
  // ...as before...
})
export class AppModule { }
```

- Note the `provideStore` call in `imports`

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-add-the-storedevtools-to-the-application" -->
## Add the StoreDevTools to the Application

- Import `StoreDevtoolsModule` into our module

```ts
import { StoreDevtoolsModule } from '@ngrx/store-devtools';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ...as before...
    StoreModule.provideStore(reducer),
    // Note that you must instrument after importing StoreModule
    StoreDevtoolsModule.instrumentOnlyWithExtension({})
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

- Note the store dev tools in chrome will only work once you have injected the `Store` into a component's constructor.

```ts
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { AppState } from '../store';

export class ToDoListComponent implements OnInit {

  thingsToDo: string[];

  constructor(private store: Store<AppState>) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.store

## Picking That Apart

#####_src/app/to-do-list/to-do-list.component.ts_
```ts
    this.store
      .select('items')
      .subscribe((items: string[]) => {this.thingsToDo = items.slice();});
```

- The store is observable
- So we can filter (select) top-level elements by name
  - Only pay attention to events signalling changes to `store['items']`
- And subscribe to just those changes
- When we get a new list of items...
  - ...because that's all we're paying attention to...
- ...we copy it into the list we're displaying...
  - ...because we don't way to share state

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-redux-seems-complex" -->
## Redux Seems Complex

So let's see how we'd go about deleting items:

1. Add a `Delete` button beside each item in the display.
1. Have the `onDelete` handler in `ToDoListComponent` dispatch an `ITEM_DELETE` event
   - With the text of the item to delete as its payload
1. Have the store update state when it receives that action
1. There is no Step 4

  onDelete(item) {
    this.store.dispatch({type: ITEM_DELETE, payload: item});
  }
}
```

- Compilation error because `ITEM_DELETE` doesn't yet exist

  case ITEM_DELETE:
    newState = {
      items: state.items.filter(item => {return item != action.payload})
    };
    return newState;

  ...other cases...

  }
}
```

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-getting-info-from-store" -->
## Getting Information from a Store

- State is exposed through the `Store` service as an `Observable` stream
- The `select` carries information away from the store
  - `Store` provides a `.select()` method to select pieces of state:
  - By key: `this.store.select('people')`
  - By nested key: `this.store.select('city', 'people')`
  - By function: `this.store.select(state => state.people)`
- Can chain other operators like `.filter()`, `.map()` to have finer-grained control over selected data

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-handle-async-events" -->
## Handling Async Events in the Application With Redux

- The `@ngrx/effects` library is responsible for business logic and async actions
  - E.g., HTTP calls
- Does not keep local state
- Listens on the action stream
  - Adheres to "Action In/Action Out"
- Typical use is:
  1. Take user input
  1. make HTTP call
  1. Provide output to go into store

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-handling-side-effects" -->

    .map(() => {
      type : ActionTypes.REMOVE_BOOK_SUCCESS,
      payload : book.id
    })

<!-- .slide: id="redux-faq-is-the-reducer-the-store" -->
## FAQ

**Is the reducer the store?**

No, a reducer only describes _how_ the store's state should change
based on a dispatched action. Our actual state is stored outside of
our reducers. In the case of `@ngrx`, state is stored within an
`Observable` stream that can be listened to.

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-faq-can-i-have-more-than-one-store" -->
## FAQ

**Can I have more than one store?**

No, redux uses one global store to manage state., however it is common practice
to divide your store into separate areas of concern.

Just as we can configure our store like this:
`StoreModule.provideStore(reducer)`
We are also able to pass in an object and associate a reducer with a given piece
of our state
`StoreModule.provideStore({ todos: todosReducer, users: usersReducer })`

We can also take advantage of functional composition, and "combine" multiple
reducers into one using the `combineReducers` helper function `@ngrx` provides.

+++
<!-- .slide id="redux-faq-does-the-ui-broadcast-actions" -->
## FAQ

**Does the UI broadcast actions and store broadcast actions back?**

The UI should not broadcast actions directly, it can and often should
dispatch actions through "action creator" methods which can be made
available through a component or service.

In a more traditional Flux architecture, while a store may have
broadcast actions whenever state changed, Redux does not. Instead of
reacting to actions dispatched out from our store, we instead react to
the changes in our state itself, we don't concerned ourselves with
*how* state has changed.

The actions are generally what we call the events being broadcast to
the store.  When events leave the store due to a state change it is
done through a store select.

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-faq-can-we-call-methods-directly" -->
## FAQ

**Instead of dealing with observables, can we simply call methods directly?**

By calling methods directly, we must now take on the responsibility of
manually managing state (often spread across numerous locations) and
ensuring that all concerned portions of our application are notified
of updated state. This approach tends to be more error-prone and is
more difficult to maintain and scale in larger applications.

The advantage of Redux is that this state management is handled in one
location which is easier to reason about, and our application can
simply react whenever application state changes.

+++
<!-- .slide: id="redux-faq-can-i-roll-my-own" -->
## FAQ

**I have an awesome idea/implementation that does the same thing, can I use that?**

Absolutely. Ultimately Redux is just a pattern for state
management. Be warned however that many of the strengths of Redux lie
in its conventions and community support. Convention allows other
developers to ramp up quickly on a pattern they're already familiar
with, and community support means better tooling, more
middleware,updates/bug fixes, and a larger knowledge base to draw
upon. Choose whichever solution ends up being best for you and your
team.
